#Project Name: Retro Pigskin

----------------
Desired Outcome
----------------

1) What is it?

  • A responsive app that specializes in older full-length NFL games.
  • It allows the user to search for games by the year that the game was played.


2) Who is it for?

  • For NFL fans that hold value in seeing older full-length NFL games


3) What does it get them?

  • This app allows die hard NFL fans to relive the excitement of seeing their favorite NFL stars play in
    the game of their choice, from the list of games provided.

  • It will also show starting roster API data for the game currently being watched.


4) How will they know they have it?

  • The app will allow the user to stream full-length NFL games on their mobile device and desktop.


4b) What does wildly successful look like?

  • User would have option to comment on each video

  • Would be able to search videos by player name and team name

  • A sign-up button for saving videos to favorites list

  • An video upload feature


5) Problems with having the app?

  • This app is based on YouTube video content, therefore if a video is randomly removed from YouTube,
    the video will no longer play on this app.


6) Why don't they have it already?

  • The NFL games may only be available on YouTube and therefore certain users may not be aware of how to find
    the content they're looking for

  • The games are rare, so the number of apps that show this content may be few.


7) What are the incremental steps to the solution?

  • Show at least 1 NFL game per year between 1998 - 2004

  • Give option to search list of NFL games by year

  • Responsive view

  • Roster API data for each video
