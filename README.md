Desired Outcome
----------------

1) What is it?

  • An app that specializes in older full-length NFL games.
  • It allows the user to search for games by the year that the game was played.

2) Who is it for?

  • For NFL fans that hold value in seeing older full-length NFL games

3) What does it get them?

  • This app allows die hard NFL fans to relive the excitement of seeing their favorite NFL stars play in
    the game of their choice, from the list of games provided.

  • It will also show starting roster API data for the game currently being watched.

4) How will they know they have it?

  • The app will allow the user to stream full-length NFL games on their mobile device and desktop.


5) Problems with having the app?

  • This app is based on YouTube video content, therefore if a video is randomly removed from YoutTube,
    the video will no longer play on this app.

6) Why don't they have the app already?

  • The NFL games may only be available on YouTube and therefore certain users may not be aware of how to find
    the content they're looking for

  • The games are rare, so the number of apps that show this content may be few
